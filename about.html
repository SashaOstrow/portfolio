            I’m a University of Oregon undergraduate who is majoring in advertising with a minor in business administration and computer information technology (CIT). My hometown is in the outskirts of Portland, Oregon in a city called Tigard. I’ve lived in Oregon my whole life and hope to continue living in the Northwest after graduation. In the meantime, I’m enjoying my time at university and exploring the city of Eugene outside of the college campus.

            I hope in the future to use each part of my major and minors outside of college to pursue my passion for creative work. My hope is to work with companies developing apps or sites to make interactive work. In my profession I want to be able to feel like I'm not just doing assigned work from the company I work for, rather I want to feel like I’m creating new work. My goal is to do work I'm passionate about, and be able to develop my own creative style that can stand out from other people's work. Growing up I’ve always been into art and the creative side of school work. As a kid who loved creativity, I want to use what I feel most comfortable in doing as an advantage in my academic and professional work. I want to be able to do work that can make an impact on people. I want to make work that makes people think, and maybe change the way they think. I want to inspire people.

            Using the knowledge I learned from minoring in business administration, it would help me better collaborate with companies to understand in depth how companies operate, working with budgets, cooperating in teams, and how my role in the company can directly make an impact. Additionally, if I choose to pursue freelancing, this knowledge would equip me to start and manage my own business successfully.
