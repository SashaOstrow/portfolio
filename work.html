        <h2>Photo Package</h2>
        <p class="section-description"> In “Gateway Into Media” this photo package is meant to display my skills of being able to gather information about an individual through an interview and be able to tell their story visually in an interesting way. I went to The Oregon Horse Center and followed one equestrian named Hope Rose and her horse Bitz. Hope is well acquainted with horses and is here at the Oregon Horse Center to show her abilities off. She showed her training skills during the show by navigating a series of obstacles. Rose and Bitz work together during the show as a test of partnership, skill, and trust.

        <h2>Ad Campaign</h2>
        <p class="section-description"> In “Creative Strategist” me and my group landed on the idea of making a campaign to encourage people to donate clothes to decrease the amount of clothes that end up in landfills and end up impacting the environment. We collaborated with the company depop, which is an online app that allows people to resell old clothes. The ads used in this campaign were meant to catch peoples eyes and stand out from other competing ads. The way we did this was by using the bright red color depop is known for in the ads contrasted with duller images to make work that pop outs. </p>
